As SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions become more complex, managing multiple web parts, extensions, and libraries in one project can be difficult. **Npm workspaces** offer a modern solution for managing multiple SPFx projects within a single repository, known as a **monorepo**.

In this post, we’ll look at how NPM workspaces can enhance your SPFx development workflow and explain why workspaces are becoming a more appealing choice for modern SharePoint development.

### What Are npm Workspaces?

Introduced in npm 7, **workspaces** are a feature designed for managing multiple projects within a single repository, commonly called a **monorepo**. Workspaces allow projects within the monorepo to share dependencies, making version management easier, reducing redundancy, and simplifying the build and deployment processes.

Npm workspaces offer a modern solution for managing multiple SPFx projects within a single repository, known as a monorepo. This approach addresses several challenges associated with traditional SPFx libraries, such as dependency management, version control, and build efficiency. By centralizing dependencies and organizing projects under a unified structure, npm workspaces streamline the development process, reduce redundancy, and simplify the build and deployment processes. This makes them an appealing choice for modern SharePoint development, enhancing workflow efficiency and maintainability.

### **How It Works**

* All SPFx projects are placed inside a **unified monorepo** (`packages/` folder).
    
* Dependencies are **installed once** at the root level (`node_modules/`), ensuring consistency.
    
* Shared code (components, APIs, utilities) is stored in a **central module** and used directly in all SPFx projects.
    
* Updates are **instantly available** to all SPFx solutions when rebuilt.

## **Why Use NPM Workspaces for SPFx?**

Managing dependencies across multiple SharePoint Framework (SPFx) projects can quickly become a **time-consuming and error-prone task**. Each project traditionally maintains its own `node_modules` folder, leading to:

* **Version mismatches** – Different SPFx solutions using conflicting versions of the same package.
    
* **Redundant package installations** – Wasted disk space and long install times.
    
* **Manual updates** – Updating dependencies across multiple projects one by one.
    
* **Difficulty in sharing code** – Custom libraries have to be duplicated or published separately.
    
* **Code Duplication** – Every project has its own `services/`, `utils/`, and `styles/`, leading to **redundant code**.
    

**Traditional SPFx Folder Structure without Library Component or NPM Workspaces:**

```bash
sqlKopierenBearbeitenspfx-projects/             🔹 Folder containing multiple independent SPFx solutions
│── spfx-webpart1/         🔹 First SPFx Web Part (Independent Project)
│   │── src/
│   │   │── components/     🔹 Web Part-specific UI components
│   │   │── services/       🔹 API calls and business logic
│   │   │── utils/          🔹 Helper functions (Duplicated in each project)
│   │   │── styles/         🔹 Local SCSS styles
│   │── node_modules/       🔹 Project-specific dependencies
│   │── package.json        🔹 Contains dependencies (installed separately)
│── spfx-webpart2/         🔹 Second SPFx Web Part (Independent Project)
│   │── (Same structure as `spfx-webpart1`)
│── spfx-webpart3/         🔹 Third SPFx Web Part (Independent Project)
│   │── (Same structure as above)
```

**Example of Duplication in Each Project:**

* `spfx-webpart1/src/utils/formatDate.ts`
    
* `spfx-webpart2/src/utils/formatDate.ts`
    
* `spfx-webpart3/src/utils/formatDate.ts`
    

If `formatDate.ts` needs an update, **every project must be modified separately**—a maintenance nightmare.

### **How NPM Workspaces Solve These Issues**

NPM Workspaces allow multiple SPFx projects to be managed within a **single repository (monorepo)**, where dependencies are centrally installed and maintained.

* **Centralized Dependency Management** – NPM Workspaces ensure that all SPFx projects use a single source for dependencies, eliminating version mismatches and reducing redundant package installations. This approach simplifies updates, improves consistency, and optimizes project maintenance across multiple solutions.
    
* **Consistent Package Versions** – Avoid mismatches between SPFx projects. By defining dependencies at the root level, NPM Workspaces ensure all SPFx projects use the same package versions, preventing conflicts and unexpected bugs. This eliminates the hassle of manually syncing versions across multiple solutions.
    
* **Code Sharing** – Share custom components and utilities across projects without extra setup. NPM Workspaces allow you to create and reuse shared modules, such as UI components, API services, and utility functions, across multiple SPFx projects. This reduces code duplication and ensures consistency in functionality and styling.
    
* **Scalable and modular for large teams** – NPM Workspaces allow multiple SPFx projects to share code efficiently while remaining independent, making collaboration easier across large development teams. As projects grow, this structure ensures maintainability, reduces redundancy, and streamlines updates.
    
* **Faster Install and Build Times** – No more downloading the same package multiple times. Since dependencies are installed once and shared across all projects, workspaces significantly reduce installation time and disk space usage. This speeds up development, CI/CD pipelines, and overall project performance.
    
* **Improved team collaboration** – Developers work on a single, unified codebase instead of multiple repositories.

### Folder Structure with NPM Workspaces

**Example Folder Structure in NPM Workspaces:**

```bash
vbnetKopierenBearbeitenspfx-monorepo/
│── package.json         🔹 Defines NPM Workspaces
│── packages/            🔹 Contains all SPFx projects
│   │── webpart1/        🔹 First SPFx Web Part
│   │── webpart2/        🔹 Second SPFx Web Part
│   │── shared-utils/    🔹 Shared helper functions (e.g., API wrappers)
│   │── shared-styles/   🔹 Shared SCSS styles
│── node_modules/        🔹 Shared dependencies
│── README.md            🔹 Documentation
```

*This structure scales efficiently as more SPFx projects are added.*

# **Comparison: NPM Workspaces vs. Traditional SPFx Project Structure**

| **Feature** | **Traditional SPFx Project** | **SPFx with NPM Workspaces** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Project Structure** | Separate repositories or folders | Single monorepo with multiple projects |
| Code Reuse | Shared code must be copied or referenced via SPFx Library Component | Shared components and utilities are directly imported from a central module |
| Dependency Management | Each project installs dependencies separately, leading to version mismatches | Dependencies are centralized, ensuring consistency across all projects |
| Updating Shared Code | Requires manual updates in each project | Updates apply automatically across all projects when rebuilt |
| Performance & Maintenance | Higher maintenance effort due to redundant dependencies | Lower maintenance as dependencies are installed once for all projects |
| Collaboration | Teams work on isolated projects, often duplicating work | Teams collaborate on a unified codebase, reducing duplication |

# **Exploring Other Alternatives: SPFx Library Components**

**A common alternative besides the npm library is SPFx Library Components.** They provide a structured and version-controlled method to share reusable code across multiple SPFx solutions. Instead of duplicating components or utilities, teams can maintain a **centralized library** that various SPFx web parts and extensions can reference.

#### **How It Works:**

* A **separate SPFx Library Component** is created and packaged as a `.sppkg` file.
    
* The library is **deployed to the Tenant App Catalog**, making it available for other SPFx projects.
    
* Each consuming SPFx solution must **install and reference the library manually** as a dependency.
    
* Updates require **rebuilding and redeploying** the library, followed by **manually updating** the version in all consuming projects.
    

**Example Structure for SPFx with Library Components**

```bash
pgsqlKopierenBearbeitenspfx-webpart1/         🔹 Independent SPFx Project
│── src/
│   │── components/     🔹 Web Part-specific UI components
│   │── services/      🔹 API calls and business logic
│   │── utils/         🔹 Helper functions
│   │── styles/        🔹 Local SCSS styles
│── node_modules/      🔹 Project-specific dependencies
│── package.json       🔹 Dependency configuration

spfx-webpart2/         🔹 Another independent SPFx Project
│── (Same structure as webpart1)

spfx-library-component/ 🔹 Shared Library Component
│── src/
│   │── components/     🔹 Reusable UI components (e.g., Buttons, Modals)
│   │── hooks/          🔹 Shared React Hooks
│   │── services/       🔹 API helpers (e.g., SharePoint PnP JS functions)
│   │── styles/         🔹 Shared SCSS styles
│── package.json       🔹 Needs to be manually updated in consuming projects
```

### Summary: When to Use npm Workspaces

* **Use npm Workspaces** when:
    
    * You have a large, multi-component SPFx solution that benefits from centralized dependency management.
        
    * You want to simplify your project structure by managing all SPFx components within a single repository.
        
    * You need efficient, simultaneous builds and want to streamline CI/CD pipelines.
        
    * You’re developing closely related components that share dependencies, libraries, or utility functions.
        
* **Use SPFx Libraries** when:
    
    * You need to create a highly reusable, standalone library that may be used across multiple projects or repositories.
        
    * Your organization prefers managing separate repositories for each project or has complex deployment requirements.
        
    * You want more control over when updates are pulled into individual projects, avoiding immediate changes across all projects.
        

### **Conclusion**

For SPFx developers, npm workspaces offer a powerful alternative to traditional library components by enabling centralized dependency management, easier code reuse, and better scalability.
